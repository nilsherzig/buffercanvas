# Buffer Canvas

![Preview Small](./preview_small.png)

This project is very much work in progress!

Live Demo: https://canvas.nilsherzig.com (read keybinds below)

(name is subject to change)

Basically https://github.com/heyman/heynote/ but as a (self-hostable) website.

I really like `heynote`, but I dislike desktop programs. This is going to be my attempt to implement something like `heynote` as a website, 
Which would allow easy mobile access and build in sync / share capabilities.

### Keybinds
