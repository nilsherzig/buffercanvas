# Buffer Canvas

(name is subject to change)

Basically https://github.com/heyman/heynote/ but as a (self-hostable) website.

I really like `heynote`, but I dislike desktop programs. This is going to be my attempt to implement something like `heynote` as a website, 
Which would allow easy mobile access and build in sync / share capabilities.
